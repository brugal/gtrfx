This is a bit too simple. The diode circuit does not perform hard
clipping when driven at moderate levels.

Something like

out = tanh (in) (or tanhf() if available)

or

out = in / sqrt (1 + in * in)

with some scaling of in and out will come very close
to the real behaviour. Alternatively change the '1' in
the sqrt to some other constant to set the normal
operation levels.
